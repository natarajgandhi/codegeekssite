    <p>Hi Iam Billa, your friendly Code Geeks bot! I can perform the following tasks currently. But I am still at school and learning new tasks every day!</p>

    <ul> <!-- changed to list in the tutorial -->
      <li>Perform a build</li>
      <li>Run code scans</li>
      <li>Perform Scrum Calls</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I believe I can keep evolving and grow over time to perform more advanced tasks and really help my team simplify many of their tasks.</p>
